# Convert sale_date to Date type for better handling
data$sale_date <- as.Date(data$sale_date, format="%m/%d/%Y")

# Subset data for houses under $1,000,000
under_1m <- data %>% filter(sale_price < 1000000)

# Subset data for houses over $1,000,000
over_1m <- data %>% filter(sale_price >= 1000000)
```

Below is a breakdown of four variables within the Pierce County House Sales data set provided. We decided to choose House Square Feet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Year Built for our four fields to review.

Initially, we ran a correlation analysis to see which variables have stronger relationships with sales price. This correlation analysis showed that the four fields selected have positive correlation to sales price. House Square Feet has a strong correlation, Bathrooms is moderate, while Bedrooms and Year Built is somewhat weaker. These can be seen below:

```{R, echo=FALSE}
  # Select columns for correlation analysis
  vars <- under_1m %>% select(sale_price, house_square_feet, year_built, bedrooms, bathrooms)
  
  # Calculate correlation matrix
  cor_matrix <- cor(vars, use = "complete.obs")
  
  # Print correlation with sale_price
  cor_price <- cor_matrix["sale_price", ]
  cor_price <- cor_price[order(abs(cor_price), decreasing = TRUE)]
  
  # Convert to data frame for kable
  cor_price_df <- as.data.frame(t(cor_price))
  colnames(cor_price_df) <- colnames(cor_matrix)  # Set column names
  rownames(cor_price_df) <- "Correlation"
  
  # Display with kable
  kable(cor_price_df, 
        caption = "Correlation of Variables with Sale Price Under $1M",
        col.names = colnames(cor_price_df),
        align = "c", 
        format = "markdown")
```

-   For our variable that shows the highest correlation to sales price, we decided to plot a histogram for House Square Feet.

```{R, echo=FALSE}

  # Plot distribution of house square feet for houses under $1M
    house_square_feet <- ggplot(under_1m, aes(x = house_square_feet)) +
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "green", color = "black") +
      labs(title = "Distribution of House Square Feet (Under $1M)", x = "Square Feet", y = "Frequency")

      summarize(
        mean_square_feet = comma(mean(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),
        median_square_feet = comma(median(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),
        sd_square_feet = comma(sd(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),

```

-   Similar to houses sold under \$1M, there is a Right Skewed trend for . However, the spead of data is not nearly as uniform as with the houses under \$1M.

-   For Bathrooms, we decieded to create a Box Plot.

-   For our variable that shows the lowest corelation to sales price, we decieded to plot a histogram for Year Built.
