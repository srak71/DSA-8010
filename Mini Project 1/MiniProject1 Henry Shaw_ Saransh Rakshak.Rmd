```


Below is a breakdown of four variables selected within the Pierce County House Sales dataset provided.
We decided to choose House Square Feet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Year Built for our four fields to review.

Initially, we ran a correlation analysis to see which variables have stronger relationships with sales price. This correlation analysis showed that the four fields selected have a positive correlation to sales price. House Square Feet has a strong correlation, Bathrooms are moderate, while Bedrooms and Year Built is somewhat weaker. These can be seen below:

```{R, echo=FALSE}
  # Select columns for correlation analysis
  vars <- data %>% select(sale_price, house_square_feet, year_built, bedrooms, bathrooms)
  
  # Calculate correlation matrix
  cor_matrix <- cor(vars, use = "complete.obs")
  
  # Print correlation with sale_price
  cor_price <- cor_matrix["sale_price", ]
  cor_price <- cor_price[order(abs(cor_price), decreasing = TRUE)]
  
  # Convert to data frame for kable
  cor_price_df <- as.data.frame(t(cor_price))
  colnames(cor_price_df) <- colnames(cor_matrix)  # Set column names
  rownames(cor_price_df) <- "Correlation"
  
  # Display with kable
  kable(cor_price_df, 
        caption = "Correlation of Variables with Sale Price - Entire Dataset",
        col.names = colnames(cor_price_df),
        align = "c", 
        format = "markdown")
```

- When we break down the correlation analysis to just the houses under $1,000,000 subset, we can see all four variables increase in their correlation to sales price. This can be seen below:
```{R, echo=FALSE}
  # Select columns for correlation analysis (House Square Feet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Year Built)
  vars_under <- under_1m %>% select(sale_price, house_square_feet, year_built, bedrooms, bathrooms)
  
  # Calculate correlation matrix
  cor_matrix_under <- cor(vars_under, use = "complete.obs")
  
  # Print correlation with sale_price value
  cor_price_under <- cor_matrix_under["sale_price", ]
  cor_price_under <- cor_price_under[order(abs(cor_price_under), decreasing = TRUE)]
  
  # Convert to data frame for kable for table printing
  cor_price_df_under <- as.data.frame(t(cor_price_under))
  colnames(cor_price_df_under) <- colnames(cor_matrix_under)  # Set column names
  rownames(cor_price_df_under) <- "Correlation"
  
  # Display correlation table with kable format
  kable(cor_price_df_under, 
        caption = "Correlation of Variables with Sale Price - Under $1,000,000",
        col.names = colnames(cor_price_df_under),
        align = "c", 
        format = "markdown")
```

- When we break down the correlation analysis to just the houses over $1,000,000 subset, we can see the chosen variables decrease in their correlation to sales price. House Square Feet and Bathrooms have a negative correlation now. This can be seen below:
```{R, echo=FALSE}
  # Select columns for correlation analysis (House Square Feet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Year Built)
  vars_over <- over_1m %>% select(sale_price, house_square_feet, year_built, bedrooms, bathrooms)
  
  # Calculate correlation matrix
  cor_matrix_over <- cor(vars_over, use = "complete.obs")
  
  # Print correlation with sale_price value
  cor_price_over <- cor_matrix_over["sale_price", ]
  cor_price_over <- cor_price_over[order(abs(cor_price_over), decreasing = TRUE)]
  
  # Convert to data frame for kable for table printing
  cor_price_df_over <- as.data.frame(t(cor_price_over))
  colnames(cor_price_df_over) <- colnames(cor_matrix_over)  # Set column names
  rownames(cor_price_df_over) <- "Correlation"
  
  # Display correlation table with kable format
  kable(cor_price_df_over, 
        caption = "Correlation of Variables with Sale Price - Over $1,000,000",
        col.names = colnames(cor_price_df_over),
        align = "c", 
        format = "markdown")
```


### Histogram for House Square Feet with Sales Price under $1,000,000.

For our variable that shows the highest correlation to sales price, we decided to plot a histogram for House Square Feet.

```{R, echo=FALSE}

  # Plot distribution of house square feet for houses under $1,000,000
    house_square_feet <- ggplot(under_1m, aes(x = house_square_feet)) +
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "green", color = "black") +
      labs(title = "Distribution of House Square Feet under $1,000,000", x = "Square Feet", y = "Frequency")
 
    # Show the plot House Square Feet under $1,000,000
    house_square_feet  
    
    # Summary statistics for House Square Feet under $1,000,000
    house_square_feet_summary <- under_1m %>%
      summarize(
        mean_square_feet = comma(mean(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),
        median_square_feet = comma(median(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),
        sd_square_feet = comma(sd(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),
        min_square_feet = comma(min(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE)),
        max_square_feet = comma(max(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE))
      )
    
    # Summary 2 statistics for House Square Feet under $1,000,000
    house_square_feet_summary2 <- under_1m %>%
      summarize(
       sd_square_feet = formatC(sd(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE), format = "f", digits = 2),
          range_square_feet = formatC(max(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE) - min(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE), format = "f", digits = 2),
          iqr_square_feet = formatC(IQR(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE), format = "f", digits = 2),
          skewness_square_feet = formatC(e1071::skewness(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE), format = "f", digits = 2),
          kurtosis_square_feet = formatC(e1071::kurtosis(house_square_feet, na.rm = TRUE), format = "f", digits = 2)
      )

    # Display the summary statistics in a table format for House Square Feet under $1,000,000
    kable(house_square_feet_summary, 
      col.names = c("Mean Square Feet", "Median Square Feet", 
                    "SD of Square Feet", "Min Square Feet", "Max Square Feet"),
      caption = "Summary Statistics of House Square Feet under $1,000,000",
      align = "c")
    
    # Display the additional summary statistics in a table format for House Square Feet under $1,000,000
    kable(house_square_feet_summary2, 
      col.names = c("SD of Square Feet", "Range", "IQR", 
                    "Skewness", "Kurtosis"),
      caption = "Additional Summary Statistics of House Square Feet under $1,000,000",
      align = "c")
```
- The histogram for House Square Feet under $1,000,000 is positively or rightly skewed. This can be seen off in the visual and the summary statistics as well. With the median at 1,761, this square feet amount is closer to the min (200) than the max (5,700) which alights with the right skewness of the histogram. This is supported by the skewness value greater than 0. 

- Majority of the homes fall closer to the mean, which can be seen with more bars towards the left. The longer tail to the right shows multiple outliers of houses under $1,000,000 that have a higher total of square feet.

- Similar to houses sold under $1M, there is a Right Skewed trend and a higher distribution sold for houses under 5000 square feet. However, the spread of data is not nearly as uniform as with the houses under $1M. Additionally, the skewness is slightly greater (0.64) vs (0.59) than that for houses under 1M.


### Boxplot for Bedrooms with Sales Price under $1,000,000.
```{R, echo=FALSE} 
  # Plot boxplot of Bedrooms for houses under $1,000,000

    # Show the boxplot for Bedrooms under $1,000,000
    bedrooms
 
    # Summary statistics for Bedrooms under $1,000,000
        bedroom_summary <- under_1m %>%
        group_by(bedrooms) %>%
        summarize(
          count = n(),
          mean_sale_price = comma(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
          median_sale_price = comma(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),

    kable(bedroom_summary, 
      col.names = c("Bedrooms", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price",

      caption = "Summary Statistics for Sale Price by Number of Bedrooms under $1,000,000",
      align = "c")
```
- For bedrooms, there are eleven total unique variables. The majority of the population falls between 1 to 5 bedrooms with 16,293 houses. 

- This boxplot shows that as the number of bedrooms increases, so does the average sales price of the household. This can be seen starting with 1-bedroom houses ($344,803) with a consistent increase in the mean to 8-bedroom houses ($649,038).

- The 25-bedroom house is an outlier as the number of bedrooms increases by one until it jumps from 9 to 25


### Boxplot for Bedrooms with Sales Price over $1,000,000.
```{R, echo=FALSE} 
  # Plot boxplot of Bedrooms for houses over $1,000,000

      caption = "Summary Statistics for Sale Price by Number of Bedrooms over $1,000,000",
      align = "c")
```
- Unlike with house_sales under \$1M, houses that sold for over \$1M showed the opposite trend, with sales price decreasing as the number of rooms increases. There is also an outliar for when number of bedrooms is equal to 0. This may be caused by the purchasing of land or an un-built houses which does not have any officially listed 'rooms', rather just a property of land.



### Boxplot for Bathrooms with Sales Price under $1,000,000.
```{R, echo=FALSE}  
  # Plot boxplot of Bathrooms for houses under $1,000,000
    bathrooms <- ggplot(under_1m, aes(x = factor(bathrooms), y = sale_price)) +
      geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
      labs(
        title = "Boxplot of Sale Price by Number of Bathrooms under $1,000,000",
        x = "Number of Bathrooms",
        y = "Sale Price"
        )
 
   # Show the boxplot of Bathrooms for houses under $1,000,000
      bathrooms

          sd_sale_price = comma(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
          min_sale_price = comma(min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
          max_sale_price = comma(max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE))
        )

    # Display the summary statistics in a table format for Bathrooms for houses under $1,000,000
    kable(bathroom_summary, 
      col.names = c("Bathrooms", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                    "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
      caption = "Summary Statistics for Sale Price by Number of Bathrooms under $1,000,000",
      align = "c")
```
- For bathrooms, there are eight total unique variables. The majority of the population falls between 1 to 4 bathrooms with 16,379 houses. 

- This boxplot shows that as the number of bathrooms increases, so does the average sales price of the household. This can be seen starting with 1-bathroom houses ($314,366) with a consistent increase in the mean to 5-bathroom houses ($680,490).

- The 8-bathroom house is an outlier as the number of bedrooms increases by one until it jumps from 6 to 8. Additionally, the 6-bathroom houses are outliers as they only contain two instances within the subset under $1,000,000.

      align = "c")
```
- Unlike houses that are sold for under \$1M, for sales over \$1M, there are an extremely small amount of purchases for properties with no bathrooms. This again can be explained by the client purchasing an undeveloped area of land which may have no bedrooms or bathrooms. Also, sales price stays relatively constant even with the addition of bathrooms, showing that the amount of bathrooms in a house may not be a big factors for home-seekers willing to pay over \$1M.

```    
- The histogram for Year Built under $1,000,000 is negatively or left skewed. This can be seen off in the visual and the summary statistics as well. With the median year of 1990, this year is closer to the max (2021) than the min (1880) which aligns with the left skewness of the histogram. This is supported by the skewness value less than 0 of -0.77. 

- Majority of the homes fall closer to the mean, which can be seen with more bars towards the right. The longer tail to the left shows multiple outliers of houses under $1,000,000 that have a lower date built.
