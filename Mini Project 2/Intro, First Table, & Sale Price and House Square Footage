## Part 1: 

Can sales price be predicted? Choose any three variables other than sale price.
For each variable, explore its association with sale price using plots, tables, and summary statistics. 
Include at least one plot or table for each variable. Report appropriate statistics for each variable. 
Summarize your findings in 2-3 sentences for each variable.

In your analysis, pay attention to outliers, missing
values, and excessive zeros. In both questions, include in the text a short description of any
of these features and describe the impact that they may have on your analysis.


```{R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
  # Select columns for correlation analysis
  vars <- housing %>% select(sale_price, house_square_feet, sq_ft_thousand, year_built, decade_built, bedrooms)
  
  # Calculate correlation matrix
  cor_matrix <- cor(vars, use = "complete.obs")
  
  # Print correlation with sale_price
  cor_price <- cor_matrix["sale_price", ]
  
  # Convert to data frame for kable
  cor_price_df <- as.data.frame(t(cor_price))
  colnames(cor_price_df) <- c("Sale Price", "House Square Feet", "Square Feet (in Thousands)", "Year Built", "Decade Built", "Bedrooms")  # Set proper column names
  rownames(cor_price_df) <- "Correlation"
  
  # Display with kable

- Above is a breakdown of five variables within the Pierce County House Sales dataset provided. For Part 1 of this assignment, we decided to choose House Square Feet, Year Built, and Bedrooms for our three fields to review.

- Initially, we ran a correlation analysis to see which variables have stronger relationships with sales price. This correlation analysis showed that the three fields selected have a positive correlation to sales price. House Square Feet has a strong correlation, Year Built is moderate, while Bedrooms is somewhat weaker.

### Sale Price and House Square Footage

- First, we will analyze House square footage, the variable with the highest correlation (~0.53) to 'sale_price'.

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Summary statistics for square feet
  sq_ft_summary <- housing %>%
  group_by(sq_ft_thousand) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    mean_sale_price = as.integer(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    median_sale_price = as.integer(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    sd_sale_price = as.integer(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    min_sale_price = min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_sale_price = max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Bar chart for mean sale price for square feet
ggplot(data = sq_ft_summary, aes(x=sq_ft_thousand, y=mean_sale_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "{A1} Mean Sales Price by House Square Feet",
    x = "Square Feet (in thousands)",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label=mean_sale_price), vjust= 0.1, size=2.5, angle = 90) +
    scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::dollar_format(),  # Format y-axis as dollar values
    breaks = seq(0, max(sq_ft_summary$mean_sale_price, na.rm = TRUE), by = 1000000)  # Y-axis breaks at $1,000,000 intervals
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(min(sq_ft_summary$sq_ft_thousand, na.rm = TRUE), max(sq_ft_summary$sq_ft_thousand, na.rm = TRUE), by = 0.5)  # X-axis breaks at 0.5 increments
  )
  
```

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Plot distribution of house square feet
ggplot(housing, aes(x = factor(sq_ft_thousand), y = sale_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "{A2} Sale Price Distribution by Square Footage",
    x = "Square Feet (in thousands)",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(

    breaks = seq(0, max(sq_ft_summary$mean_sale_price, na.rm = TRUE), by = 1000000)  # Y-axis breaks at $1,000,000 intervals
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))
```

``` {R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Scatter plot with regression line for house square feet
ggscatter(housing, x = "house_square_feet", y = "sale_price",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson") +
  labs(
    title = "{A3} Sale Price Correlation with House Square Feet",
    x = "Square Feet",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,fullrange=TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())

```

```{R, echo=FALSE}
  # Display the summary statistics in a table format for House Square Feet
  kable(sq_ft_summary, 
    col.names = c("House Square Feet (in thousands)", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                  "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
    caption = "{A4} Summary Statistics for Sale Price by House Square Feet",
    align = "c")

```

- From our graph {A3}, we can see that sale price has a moderately high correlation to house square feet (Pearson Correlation ~ 0.53). We can also observe from our graph in {A2} that sale price does not have a large range of distribution for homes with 0.6 thousand to 4.1 thousand square feet. This is because there is a greater count of instances (house sales) within that range. As a result, we can conclude that house square feet does have a general association with sale price, with sale price growing as house square feet increases, as reflected in {A3}.

- Outliers can be seen in the mean distribution in Graph {A1}, and their specific values can be found using Table {A4} at 6.0 thousand square feet. This outlier is based on a single point (i.e., a single house sale) whose mean sale price of $6,090,000 is far greater than those with slightly greater or smaller house square feet. The presence of this outlier reduces our Pearson correlation coefficient and thus weakens the association between house square feet and sale price.

- Other high-value sales over $6 million, such as those in the 0.5, 1.4, and 4.2 thousand square foot categories, can also be considered outliers. However, unlike the outlier at 6.0 thousand square feet, these outliers have multiple other values in their bin, so they do not greatly affect our overall analysis between house square feet and sale price. The exact reasoning for these outliers cannot be deduced from the information at hand. However, we can speculate that these sales may have involved special circumstances, such as the house being located in a high-value area, being furnished with modern amenities, or some other factor that significantly increased their value.

### Sale Price and Year Built

- Next, we will view the association between the time the house was built and Sale Price.

```{R, echo=FALSE}
# Summary statistics for Year Built
year_built_summary <- housing %>%
group_by(decade_built) %>%
summarize(
  count = n(),
  mean_sale_price = as.integer(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  median_sale_price = as.integer(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  sd_sale_price = as.integer(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  min_sale_price = min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_sale_price = max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)
)

```

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Bar chart for mean sale price for decade built
ggplot(data = year_built_summary, aes(x=factor(decade_built), y=mean_sale_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "{B1} Mean Sales Price by Decade Built",
    x = "Decade Built",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::dollar(mean_sale_price)), vjust=1.5, size=3.5, fontface="bold") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(), breaks = seq(0, max(year_built_summary$mean_sale_price), by = 100000))

# Plot distribution of decade built
ggplot(housing, aes(x = factor(decade_built), y = sale_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "{B2} Sale Price Distribution by Decade Built", 
    x = "Decade Built",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
    scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::dollar_format(),  # Format y-axis as dollar values
    breaks = seq(0, max(sq_ft_summary$mean_sale_price, na.rm = TRUE), by = 1000000)  # Y-axis breaks at $1,000,000 intervals
  ) 

```

``` {R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Scatter plot with regression line for year built
ggscatter(housing, x = "year_built", y = "sale_price",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson") +
  labs(
    title = "{B3} Sale Price Correlation with Year Built",
    x = "Year Built",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,fullrange=TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())

```

```{R, echo=FALSE}
# Display the summary statistics in a table format for Decade built
kable(year_built_summary, 
  col.names = c("Decade Built", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
  caption = "{B4} Summary Statistics for Sale Price by Decade Built",
  align = "c")
 
``` 


- From our graph in {B3}, we can conclude that the year built has a slight association with sale price based on its Pearson Correlation (R = 0.23). We can also observe that houses built in the 1880s and 1930s have a comparably higher mean sale price than other houses built between 1880 and 1980. Thus, we can infer that there is something unique about houses built in the 1880s and 1930s that has allowed them to retain a higher value in today's market.

- Outliers can also be identified from our graphs. From the distribution graph {B2}, we see that the decades 1990, 2000, and 2010 each have a single house sale price of over 6 million—much higher than the mean sale price for those decades. These individual house sales may be special cases, such as custom-built homes or houses located in high-value areas. Since the bins for the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s contain a significant number of data points, these outliers do not significantly impact our overall analysis.

- Additionally, outliers can be seen in graph {B1}, where the sale price for houses built in the 1880s is unusually high. However, table {B4} shows that this decade has only one data point, likely a special case influenced by factors such as location or historical value. As a result, this outlier can be disregarded.
