## Part 1: 

Can sales price be predicted? Choose any three variables other than sale price.
For each variable, explore its association with sale price using plots, tables, and summary statistics. 
Include at least one plot or table for each variable. Report appropriate statistics for each variable. 
Summarize your findings in 2-3 sentences for each variable.

In your analysis, pay attention to outliers, missing
values, and excessive zeros. In both questions, include in the text a short description of any
of these features and describe the impact that they may have on your analysis.

- Above is a breakdown of five variables within the Pierce County House Sales dataset provided. For Part 1 of this assignment, we decided to choose House Square Feet, Year Built, and Bedrooms for our three fields to review.

- Initially, we ran a correlation analysis to see which variables have stronger relationships with sales price. This correlation analysis showed that the three fields selected have a positive correlation to sales price. House Square Feet has a strong correlation, Year Built is moderate, while Bedrooms is somewhat weaker.

### A) Sale Price and House Square Footage

- First, we will analyze House square footage, the variable with the highest correlation (~0.53) to 'sale_price'.

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Summary statistics for square feet
  sq_ft_summary <- housing %>%
  group_by(sq_ft_thousand) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    mean_sale_price = as.integer(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    median_sale_price = as.integer(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    sd_sale_price = as.integer(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    min_sale_price = min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_sale_price = max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Bar chart for mean sale price for square feet

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "{A1} Mean Sales Price by House Square Feet",
    x = "Square Feet (in thousands)",

  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(min(sq_ft_summary$sq_ft_thousand, na.rm = TRUE), max(sq_ft_summary$sq_ft_thousand, na.rm = TRUE), by = 0.5)  # X-axis breaks at 0.5 increments

```

    x = "Square Feet (in thousands)",

  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(

    breaks = seq(0, max(sq_ft_summary$mean_sale_price, na.rm = TRUE), by = 1000000)  # Y-axis breaks at $1,000,000 intervals
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  theme(

    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11)     # Increase y-axis text font size
  )
```

``` {R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Scatter plot with regression line for house square feet
ggscatter(housing, x = "house_square_feet", y = "sale_price",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson") +
  labs(
    title = "{A3} Sale Price Correlation with House Square Feet",
    x = "Square Feet",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,fullrange=TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())

```

```{R, echo=FALSE}
  # Display the summary statistics in a table format for House Square Feet
  kable(sq_ft_summary, 
    col.names = c("House Square Feet (in thousands)", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                  "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
    caption = "{A4} Summary Statistics for Sale Price by House Square Feet",
    align = "c")

```

- From our graph {A3}, we can see that sale price has a moderately high correlation to house square feet (Pearson Correlation ~ 0.53). We can also observe from our graph in {A2} that sale price does not have a large range of distribution for homes with 0.6 thousand to 4.1 thousand square feet. This is because there is a greater count of instances (house sales) within that range. As a result, we can conclude that house square feet does have a general association with sale price, with sale price growing as house square feet increases, as reflected in {A3}.

- Outliers can be seen in the mean distribution in Graph {A1}, and their specific values can be found using Table {A4} at 6.0 thousand square feet. This outlier is based on a single point (i.e., a single house sale) whose mean sale price of $6,090,000 is far greater than those with slightly greater or smaller house square feet. The presence of this outlier reduces our Pearson Correlation Coefficient and thus weakens the association between house square feet and sale price.

- Other high-value sales over $6 million, such as those in the 0.5, 1.4, and 4.2 thousand square foot categories, can also be considered outliers. However, unlike the outlier at 6.0 thousand square feet, these outliers have multiple other values in their bin, so they do not greatly affect our overall analysis between house square feet and sale price. The exact reasoning for these outliers cannot be deduced from the information at hand. However, we can speculate that these sales may have involved special circumstances, such as the house being located in a high-value area, being furnished with modern amenities, or some other factor that significantly increased their value.

- The exact reasoning for any of these outliers cannot be deducted from the information at hand, however, we can predict these sales were special situations where the house may be located geographically in a high value area or the house could be furnished with modern amenities, or some other reason that increases their value far greater than expected.

### B) Sale Price and Year Built

- Next, we will view the association between the time the house was built and Sale Price.

```{R, echo=FALSE}
# Summary statistics for Year Built
year_built_summary <- housing %>%
group_by(decade_built) %>%
summarize(
  count = n(),
  mean_sale_price = as.integer(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  median_sale_price = as.integer(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  sd_sale_price = as.integer(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  min_sale_price = min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_sale_price = max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)
)

```

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Bar chart for mean sale price for decade built
ggplot(data = year_built_summary, aes(x=factor(decade_built), y=mean_sale_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "{B1} Mean Sales Price by Decade Built",
    x = "Decade Built",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::dollar(mean_sale_price)), vjust=1.5, size=3.5, fontface="bold") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(), breaks = seq(0, max(year_built_summary$mean_sale_price), by = 100000)) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase x-axis title font size
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase y-axis title font size
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),    # Increase x-axis text font size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11)     # Increase y-axis text font size
  )
```

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Plot distribution of decade built
ggplot(housing, aes(x = factor(decade_built), y = sale_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "{B2} Sale Price Distribution by Decade Built", 
    x = "Decade Built",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase x-axis title font size
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase y-axis title font size
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),    # Increase x-axis text font size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11)     # Increase y-axis text font size
  )
```

``` {R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Scatter plot with regression line for year built
ggscatter(housing, x = "year_built", y = "sale_price",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson") +
  labs(
    title = "{B3} Sale Price Correlation with Year Built",
    x = "Year Built",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,fullrange=TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())

```

```{R, echo=FALSE}
# Display the summary statistics in a table format for Decade built
kable(year_built_summary, 
  col.names = c("Decade Built", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
  caption = "{B4} Summary Statistics for Sale Price by Decade Built",
  align = "c")
 
``` 


- From our graph in {B3}, we can conclude that the year built has a slight association with sale price based on its Pearson Correlation (R = 0.23). We can also observe that houses built in the 1880s and 1930s have a comparably higher mean sale price than other houses built between 1880 and 1980. Thus, we can infer that there is something unique about houses built in the 1880s and 1930s that has allowed them to retain a higher value in today's market.

- Outliers can also be identified from our graphs. From the distribution graph {B2}, we see that the decades 1990, 2000, and 2010 each have a single house sale price of over 6 million—much higher than the mean sale price for those decades. These individual house sales may be special cases, such as custom-built homes or houses located in high-value areas. Since the bins for the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s contain a significant number of data points, these outliers do not significantly impact our overall analysis.

- Additionally, outliers can be seen in graph {B1}, where the sale price for houses built in the 1880s is unusually high. However, table {B4} shows that this decade has only one data point, likely a special case influenced by factors such as location or historical value. As a result, this outlier can be disregarded.

<br>

### C) Sale Price and Number of Bedrooms


- Lastly, we will view the association between Number of Bedrooms and Sale Price. Let us find the summary statistics for Bedrooms in relation to Sale Price.

```{R, echo = FALSE}
# Summary statistics for Bedrooms
bedroom_summary <- housing %>%
group_by(bedrooms) %>%
summarize(
  count = n(),
  mean_sale_price = as.integer(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  median_sale_price = as.integer(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  sd_sale_price = as.integer(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  min_sale_price = min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_sale_price = max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Bar chart for mean sale price for bedrooms
ggplot(data = bedroom_summary, aes(x = factor(bedrooms), y = mean_sale_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "{C1} Mean Sale Price by Number of Rooms",
    x = "Number of Bedrooms",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::dollar(mean_sale_price)), vjust=1.5, size=3.5, fontface="bold") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(), breaks = seq(0, max(bedroom_summary$mean_sale_price), by = 100000)) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase x-axis title font size
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase y-axis title font size
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),    # Increase x-axis text font size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11)     # Increase y-axis text font size
  )

```

```{R fig.align="center",fig.width = 14, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Plot distribution of bedrooms
ggplot(housing, aes(x = factor(bedrooms), y = sale_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "{C2} Sale Price Distribution by Number of Rooms",
    x = "Number of Bedrooms",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase x-axis title font size
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13),  # Increase y-axis title font size
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),    # Increase x-axis text font size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11)     # Increase y-axis text font size
  )
```

``` {R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# scatter plot for number of bedrooms with regression line
ggscatter(data = housing, x = "bedrooms", y = "sale_price",
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson") +
  labs(
    title = "{C3} Sale Price Correlation with Number of Bedrooms",
    x = "Number of Bedrooms",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE,fullrange=TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())

```

```{R, echo = FALSE}
# Display the summary statistics in a table format for Bedrooms
kable(bedroom_summary, 
  col.names = c("Bedrooms", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
  caption = "{C4} Summary Statistics for Sale Price by Number of Bedrooms",
  align = "c")

```

- The summary statistics {C4} indicate that as the number of bedrooms increases, the mean and median sale prices generally rise. The correlation between the number of bedrooms and sale price, while statistically significant (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.21), is weak. This suggests that while the number of bedrooms has some effect on sale price, other factors (such as location or property type) likely play a more influential role. Properties with 0 bedrooms have a relatively high mean sale price of $652,402, likely representing special types of properties that distort the expected trend.

- The housing data point with 25 bedrooms is an outlier due to its unusually high number of rooms and its singular occurrence in the dataset. Additionally, outliers in sale price, as shown in graph {C2}, reveal some prices exceeding 6 million across various bedroom counts, particularly in the 1-5 bedroom range. These extreme values may skew the data. Moreover, the high prices in the 0-bedroom category suggest possible data issues, such as excessive zeros or missing values, which could affect the overall analysis.


<br>

### Can Sale Price be predicted?

Based on the data from graphs A - C, sale price can be predicted to a certain extent using variables such as house square footage, year built, and number of bedrooms.

    House Square Footage: There is a moderate correlation (Pearson correlation ~0.53) between house square footage and sale price. As square footage increases, the sale price generally rises, although there are outliers, particularly at higher square footage values—that slightly reduce this correlation.

    Year Built: The correlation between year built and sale price is weaker (Pearson correlation ~0.23). However, certain years (such as homes built in the 1880s and 1930s) tend to have higher sale prices compared to other periods. This suggests that while newer homes may have some impact, specific historical periods or architectural styles may also influence prices.

    Number of Bedrooms: There is a weak correlation between the number of bedrooms and sale price (Pearson correlation ~0.21). While more bedrooms generally correlate with a higher price, there are notable outliers, such as homes with 0 or a very high number of bedrooms, which distort the trend.

Thus, while it is possible to predict sale price based on these factors, outliers and additional variables (e.g., location, historical significance, or amenities) likely play a significant role in the final sale price.

## Part 2: 

Is missingness informative? Create a binary variable that indicates whether
the view quality is missing. Missing values in this data file are represented as an empty
character string; that is, `'. Choose three variables. (They may, but do not need to be, the
same variables from part 1.) Explore the association between these variables and the binary
variable that you created. Follow the same instructions as in Part 1.

```{R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Select columns for correlation analysis
vars <- housing %>% select(has_view_quality, sale_price, house_square_feet, has_waterfront)

# Calculate correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(vars, use = "complete.obs")

# Print correlation with has_view_quality
cor_view <- cor_matrix["has_view_quality", ]

# Convert to data frame for kable
cor_view_df <- as.data.frame(t(cor_view))
colnames(cor_view_df) <- c("Has View Quality", "Sale Price", "House Square Feet", "Has Waterfront")  # Set proper column names
rownames(cor_view_df) <- "Correlation"

# Display with kable
kable(cor_view_df, 
      caption = "Correlation of Variables for Has View Quality",
      col.names = colnames(cor_view_df),
      align = "c", 
      format = "markdown")
```



<br>

### D) Presence of View Quality and Sale Price

- First, we will analyze 'sale_price', the variable with the highest correlation (~0.24) to 'has_view_quality'.

```{R, echo=FALSE}
# Summary statistics for sale_price
price_view_summary <- housing %>%
group_by(has_view_quality) %>%
summarize(
  count = n(),
  mean_sale_price = as.integer(mean(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  median_sale_price = as.integer(median(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  sd_sale_price = as.integer(sd(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)),
  min_sale_price = min(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_sale_price = max(sale_price, na.rm = TRUE)
)

# Display the summary statistics in a table format for Bedrooms
kable(price_view_summary, 
  col.names = c("Has View Quality", "Count", "Mean Sale Price", "Median Sale Price", 
                "SD of Sale Price", "Min Sale Price", "Max Sale Price"),
  caption = "{D1} Summary Statistics for Has View Quality by Sale Price",
  align = "c")


```

```{R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Bar chart for mean sale price for has_view_quality
ggplot(data = price_view_summary, aes(x=factor(has_view_quality), y=mean_sale_price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "{D2} Mean Sale Price by presence of View Quality description",
    x = "Has View Quality",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
    geom_text(aes(label = dollar(mean_sale_price)), vjust = 1.5, size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = dollar_format(),
    breaks = seq(0, 700000, by = 100000),  # Set breaks up to 700,000
    limits = c(0, 700000)  # Set limits for the y-axis
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No", "1" = "Yes"))

# Plot distribution of sale_price
ggplot(housing, aes(x = factor(has_view_quality), y = sale_price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "{D3} Sale Price Distribution by presence of View Quality description",
    x = "Has View Quality",
    y = "Sale Price"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No", "1" = "Yes"))

```

- The summary statistics {D1} show that the mean sale price for homes with a view quality is $696,077, which is 1.55 times greater than the mean sale price of $447,655 for those without. The difference in median sale price is even more substantial, with homes having a view quality achieving a median of $665,000 compared to $410,000 for those without. This suggests that a view quality description is a premium feature that can increase the value of a property, as confirmed by our Pearson Correlation Coefficient, calculated to be 0.2391971.

- Outliers can be seen in graph {D3} for homes without view quality, as some sale prices exceeded $6 million. However, due to the existence of 8,960 other housing sales without view quality, the mean sale price remains at a much lower value and does not skew our overall analysis.

### E) Presence of View Quality and House Square Footage

- Analyzing association between House square footage and presence of view quality description.

    y = expression("House Square Feet (sqft)")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("0" = "No", "1" = "Yes"))

```

- From our graph {E2}, we can observe a very slight correlation between the presence of view quality and square footage, with homes containing view quality data being approximately 1.24 times larger than those without a view quality description. This is reflected in our Pearson Correlation Coefficient, calculated to be 0.1353988.

- Outliers can be detected in the data. For homes without view quality data, the mean square footage is 1,855 sqft; however, this group also contains properties as large as 9,510 sqft {E1}. Similarly, outliers are present in the group of homes with view quality data, which has a mean size of 2,308 sqft but includes values as low as 1 sqft {E1}. Both of these outliers affect our analysis by lowering the Pearson Correlation Coefficient; however, due to the size of both groups, these outliers are less impactful.

### F) Presence of View Quality and Presence of Waterfront

- Analyzing association between presence of view quality description and presence of a waterfront.

```{R, echo=FALSE}

waterfront_view_freq <- housing |>
  group_by(has_view_quality) |>
  count(has_waterfront)

kable(waterfront_view_freq,
      caption = "{F1} Cross Table of Frequency for View Quality and existance of a Waterfront",
      col.names = c("Has View Quality (0=no, 1=yes)", "Has Waterfront (0=no, 1=yes)", "Frequency"))

```


```{R, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(waterfront_view_freq, aes(x = has_view_quality, y = has_waterfront, size = n, color=n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label=n, hjust = c(-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1), vjust = c(-1, 1, -1, 1.5)), size=3.5) +
  labs(
    title = "{F2} Has View Quality and Has Waterfront, by frequency",
    x = "Has View Quality (0=no, 1=yes)",
    y = "Has Waterfront (0=no, 1=yes)",
    color = "Frequency",
    size = "Frequency"
  ) 

```

- The association between the presence of view quality and waterfront is minimal. From table {F1}, we see that the vast majority of homes without waterfront access also lack a view quality designation (15,349 homes). Only a small number of properties have both waterfront and view quality (7 homes). This suggests that while there is some overlap, view quality and waterfront presence are largely independent features. This is further confirmed by our Pearson Correlation Coefficient of -0.0340727.

### Is missingness informative?

Missingness in "view_quality" proves to be informative based on data from tables and graphs D - F.

    Sale Price: Homes with recorded "view_quality" tend to have higher sale prices, with a mean of $696,077 compared to $447,655 for homes where view quality is missing. This suggests that missing "view_quality" is associated with lower-value properties. Therefore, missingness in this feature could indicate homes without premium attributes, such as a scenic view.

    Square Footage: Properties with "view_quality" data also have a higher average square footage (2,308 sq ft compared to 1,855 sq ft). This further emphasizes that missing view quality data may correspond to smaller, less expensive homes.

    Waterfront: The association between having "view_quality" and being on the waterfront is minimal, with only seven homes showing both features. Most homes either lack both features or have only one, indicating that these characteristics do not strongly co-occur.

Thus, the missingness of "view_quality" data provides valuable information, potentially signaling homes with fewer premium features.
